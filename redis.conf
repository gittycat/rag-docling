# Redis configuration for reduced logging

# Set log level to notice (less verbose than default)
# Options: debug, verbose, notice, warning
loglevel notice

# Disable syslog timestamps (only log message content)
# Note: Redis always includes timestamps in its log format, but we can reduce verbosity
