    "answer": "When specialists talk about ideas in their field, they don't use sentences any more complex than when talking about what to have for lunch.

Informal language is the athletic clothing of ideas.",

    "answer": "First, any process for deciding which ideas to ban is bound to make mistakes, and when a process makes mistakes, you need to leave a margin for error. Second, ideas are more closely related than they look, so restricting discussion of some topics propagates back into any topic that yields implications in the forbidden ones.",
