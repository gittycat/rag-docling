Python Programming Basics

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

Key Features:
- Easy to learn and read
- Interpreted language (no compilation needed)
- Dynamically typed
- Extensive standard library
- Cross-platform compatibility

Basic Data Types:
1. Numbers (int, float, complex)
2. Strings (str)
3. Lists (mutable sequences)
4. Tuples (immutable sequences)
5. Dictionaries (key-value pairs)
6. Sets (unordered collections)

Control Flow:
Python uses indentation to define code blocks. Common control structures include:
- if/elif/else statements
- for loops
- while loops
- try/except for error handling

Functions:
Functions in Python are defined using the 'def' keyword. They can have default parameters, variable-length arguments, and return multiple values.

Example:
def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
    return f"{greeting}, {name}!"

Object-Oriented Programming:
Python supports OOP with classes and objects. It includes features like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

Popular Applications:
- Web development (Django, Flask)
- Data science and machine learning (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn)
- Automation and scripting
- Scientific computing
- Game development
